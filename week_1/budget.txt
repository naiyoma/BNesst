The create_budget_db() function creates a SQLite database called "budget.db" 
        with three tables: income, expenses, and budget_goals. 
        It uses the sqlite3 library to connect to the database and execute SQL statements to create the tables.
The generate_data() function retrieves the data
        from the three tables in the "budget.db" database using the pandas library, 
        and plots the data using the matplotlib library. The data is plotted in bar charts, 
        with income data in blue and expenses data in red. Additionally, a table is created using the budget goals data, 
        which is displayed in the center of the plot.
The on_submit() function is executed when the "Submit" button is pressed.
        It retrieves the data entered in the income, expense, 
        and budget goal text fields, and inserts it into the relevant tables in the "budget.db" 
        database. 
        The function also prints a message indicating that the data has been saved to the database.
The main part of the code creates the GUI for the budget management
    application using the tkinter library. 
    It includes three text fields for entering income, 
    expenses, and budget goal data, and a "Submit" button. 
    When the "Submit" button is pressed, the on_submit() function 
    is executed and the entered data is saved to the database.
