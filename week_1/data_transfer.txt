For this function used the following libraries
    os: provides functions for working with the file system
    ftplib: provides functions for connecting to and working with FTP servers
    shutil: provides functions for copying and moving files
    schedule: provides functions for scheduling tasks to run at a specific time
    time: provides functions for working with time
    logging: provides functions for logging events and messages

The process_data function  data transfer.
    It starts by connecting to the FTP server and logging in. 
    It then retrieves a list of all the files in the server's current directory using the nlst function.

The function then creates the local directory if it doesn't already exist and downloads each file from the server to the local directory. 
If a file is a directory, it logs a message saying so and continues to the next file. 
If a file is a regular file, it is downloaded using the retrbinary method.


After downloading all the files,
the function closes the FTP connection and moves each file in the local directory to 
the same location. For each file, a message is logged indicating whether it was successfully 
transferred or not.


Finally, the script uses the schedule library to schedule the process_data function to run every day at 9:00 AM. 
The script enters an infinite loop using while True to continually run pending tasks.
The time.sleep(1) function is used to pause the loop for 1 second,
to avoid using too much processing power.


The log messages generated by the script are saved in a file named 'data_transfer.log'.
