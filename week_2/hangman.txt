The start_game function sets the word to be guessed,
initializes the number of wrong guesses to 0, 
creates sets for the remaining letters in the word and the used letters,
and then calls the hangman_game function. 



The hangman_game function is the actual hangman game.
The player is allowed to make up to 6 incorrect guesses.
The function loops through the process of taking the player's guess,
checking if it's in the remaining letters,
updating the sets of used letters and remaining letters,
and displaying the current state of the word being guessed.
If the player successfully guesses all the letters in the word,
the function ends with a message indicating that the player won.
If the player makes 6 incorrect guesses,
the function ends with a message indicating that the player lost.
