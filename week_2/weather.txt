The generate_nairobi_weather function makes an API call to OpenWeatherMap to retrieve the weather data for Nairobi.
The requests library is used to send a GET request to the API and retrieve the response,
which is in JSON format. 
The JSON data is then parsed using the json library and the relevant weather data is stored in variables weather_data
and more_data. 
The parsed data is displayed using the tkinter library,
 which is used to create a graphical user interface for the application.
  A GUI is created with a text widget displaying the weather data and a button that, 
  when clicked, opens a new window with more detailed information about the weather.

The show_more_data function is called when the "More" button is clicked in the main window.
This function creates a new window using tkinter and displays additional weather information
in a text widget.

Finally, the generate_nairobi_weather function is called to run the weather application.
